        Conversely, negative news can dampen investor sentiment, leading to selling pressure and a decrease in stock prices.
        News about competitors can also have a ripple effect on a company's stock price. 
        For instance, if a competitor announces a groundbreaking new product, other companies in the industry might see their stock prices fall as investors anticipate a loss of market share. The positive score, neutral score and negative score are sentiment score. 
        Sentiment score involves evaluating and interpreting subjective information in text data to understand the sentiments, opinions, or emotions expressed.
        The positive score, neutral score, and negative scores are ratios for proportions of text that fall in each category (so these should all add up to be 1).
        These are the most useful metrics if you want to analyze the context & presentation of how sentiment is conveyed or embedded in rhetoric for a given sentence.
